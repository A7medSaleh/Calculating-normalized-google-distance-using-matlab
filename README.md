This code calculates the "Normalized Google Distance" using matlab with great accuracy.

The Normalized Google Distance is a semantic similarity measure derived from the number of hits returned by the Google search engine for a given set of keywords. Keywords with the same or similar meanings in a natural language sense tend to be "close" in units of Normalized Google Distance, while words with dissimilar meanings tend to be farther apart.

Applications are in machine learning projects like colors versus numbers, primes versus non-primes as well as a randomized massive experiment using WordNet categories. In the primes versus non-primes case and the WordNet experiment the NGD method is augmented with a Support Vector Machine classifier. The experiments consist of 25 positive examples and 25 negative ones. The WordNet experiment consisted of 100 random WordNet categories. The NGD method had a success rate of 87.25%. That is the mean is 0.8725 while the standard deviation was 0.1169. These rates are about agreement with the WordNet categories which represent the knowledge of researchers with PhD's which entered them. It is rare to see agreement less than 75%.
